# TvL Experiment
This application was built as part of my RSI 2021 project on the effects of priming in visual search. Users search for a T among Ls 
and click the left or right arrow key to specify its orientation. This version of the experiment uses "sharp" and "dotted" Ts. We use it 
for shape priming.  Other versions of the experiment use color and size as priming features.
